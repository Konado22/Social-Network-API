## <h2 id="description">Description</h2> 
This project was designed to start working with NOSQL to construct our databases as well as connect to the server and handle requests. I have enjoyed getting to learn some more current platforms as well as better practices for building these databases. As as user the goal is to create a social media API that will handle various requests from users regarding their thoughts or friends on the platform.
